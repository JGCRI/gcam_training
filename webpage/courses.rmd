# GCAM Lecture Series
<!-------------------------->

<p align="center"> <img src="images/divider.png"></p>

## Description

This course provides an interdisciplinary introduction to integrated assessment modeling (IAM) of the human and Earth systems and its wide application in policy analysis. The lecture series will cover key issues surrounding the multi-system dynamics between the economy, energy, water, agriculture and land, and climate. Students will be exposed to the IAM modeling tools that support decision-making in the context of these coupled systems. Students will acquire the theoretical and practical foundations of IAM research, including its history, evolution, application, strengths and limitations, role in policymaking, and emerging directions. After an overview of IAM research, students will dive into individual topical areas using IA modeling and assessment as the analytical tool. Lectures will be complemented with applied modeling exercises - using the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) as an example - to get hands-on knowledge of practical solutions to nexus challenges and integrated policymaking.
