## Description

**Integrated Human-Earth System Modeling and Policy Assessment:** This course provides an interdisciplinary introduction to integrated assessment (IA) modeling of the human and Earth systems and its wide application in policy analysis. Students will be exposed to key issues surrounding the multi-system dynamics between the economy, energy, water, agriculture and land, and climate. Students will also be exposed to the IA modeling tools that support decision-making in the context of these coupled systems. Students will acquire the theoretical and practical foundations of IA research, including its history, evolution, application, strengths and limitations, role in policymaking, and emerging directions. After an overview of IA research, students will dive into individual topical areas using IA modeling and assessment as the analytical tool (see below for examples of topics). Lectures will be complemented with applied modeling exercises - using the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) as an example - to get hands-on knowledge of practical solutions to nexus challenges and integrated policymaking. Students from a wide variety of disciplines are encouraged to enroll, as the course is intended to expose students to the broader, multi-disciplinary context surrounding their individual areas of study.
